{"name":"ADXL362","body":"### How to use this library:\r\nDownload the zip, and makes sure it's in your <sketchbook>/libraries folder.  Rename the directory to \"ADXL362\".  You'll want the following directory structure in your <sketchbook>/libraries folder:\r\n~~~\r\nlibraries/\r\n    ADXL362/\r\n        examples/\r\n        ADXL362.cpp\r\n        ADXL263.h\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Be Aware:\r\nThe ADXL362 is a 3.3V Device.  Please be sure that you supply 3.3V power, and 3.3V IO signals to it.  You can do this by either using logic translation, or a 3.3V Arduino.\r\n\r\n### Tutorials\r\n * [\"ADXL362 Arduino How-To\" on Analog Devices Engineer Zone](http://ez.analog.com/docs/DOC-2222)\r\n * [\"ADXL362 + Arduino: Using Interrupts to Implement Motion-Detected Sleep\" on Analog Devices Engineer Zone](http://ez.analog.com/docs/DOC-2261)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
